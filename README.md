## Introduction
Welcome to Self Defense VR! 
  This virtual reality experience was developed by Anthony Delgado Pimental, Jacob Norris, Salem Ozaki, & Jordan Proby with voiceover additions by Paul Demange. This project was created during their time at Cornell College during their Computer Science Topics Class on Virtual Reality. This VR experience was created so that aspiring self defense enthusiasts could practice their skills without having to invest the time or money in a training gym or certified instructor.

  There are assests to this project that we did not make but that we downloaded for free from the Unity Asset Store. In order to correctly clone, compile, and run this repository, you will need the following free assets:
  
  Boris the CageFighter: https://goo.gl/rwdPAK
  
  Fighting Motions Vol. 1: https://goo.gl/4hc27U
  
  OVR Utilities/Platform/Avatar: https://goo.gl/JNCKUu

  After cloning the repository to your computer and downloading the above assets, open one of the scenes in Unity and build the project being sure to add every scene besides "Animation Testing" to the build manager. Once this step is complete, feel free to build and enjoy our VR experience!
